# An Ensemble Model to Predict the Bike Sharing Demand in Seoul: Development and Evaluation

This project was done entirely in R. The first code chunk in the Rmd loads and installs necessary packages, and there is no additional installations that the user needs to do.

This project was made with the aim of predicting the bike sharing demand in Seoul, South Korea, based on predictive weather condition and date variables. I created a heterogeneous learner from bagged linear regression models, decision trees, and support vector machines.
